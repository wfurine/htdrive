# Instructions

(WFU) Please tell me if you guys are used to using a different ML library. I'll probably use tensorflow because it's much easier to install, but if you guys want I have some experience using Torch or Caffe. This will allow you to run the pre-trained net yourself. 

## Ubuntu 16.04
```
sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip
sudo apt-get install python-numpy
sudo -H pip install tensorflow
```
## Mac OSX

```
pip install tensorflow
```
